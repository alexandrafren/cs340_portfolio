# Stardew Valley Item Guide

Stardew Valley is a popular farming/country life RPG. The game is decently complex and can be intimidating to new players who are unfamiliar with the game. At its core, the game is a farming and life simulation RPG, but two of the main priorities of any player is to befriend the 34 NPC characters by talking to them and giving them gifts of items available in the game, and restoring the community center with 30 “bundles” of items available in the game. There are over 500 unique items available in the game that can comprise these bundles or serve as favorite or preferred items for the NPCs. This database and web front end will allow players to quickly see which items are needed for bundles and which items are best to use as gifts in building NPC relationships.
